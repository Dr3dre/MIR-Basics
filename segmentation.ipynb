    "Segmentation typically refers to the process of partitioning a given document into multiple segments with the goal of simplifying the representation into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze than the original document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "- in **image processing** the goal is to partition a given image into a set of regions such that each region is similar with respect to some characteristic such as color, intensity, or texture.\n",
    "- in **music**, the segmentation task is to decompose a given audio stream into acoustically meaningful sections each corresponding to a continuous time interval that is specified by a start and end boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a *fine level*, the segmentation may aim to find the boundaries between individual notes or to find the beat intervals specified by beat positions. \n",
    "At a *coarser level*, the goal may be to detect changes in instrumentation or harmony or to **find the boundaries between verse and chorus sections**."
